# linux-post-install-script
Post install script for [Pop!_OS](https://pop.system76.com/) and [Debian](https://www.debian.org/)\
The script will reboot the computer and autostart itself when needed

For Pop!_OS installs, works for both new installs and refresh installs from the built in recovery system in Pop!_OS
New install mode will install system level packages and configurations, as well as user level packages and configurations. Refresh install mode will only install system level packages and configurations, as the recovery system in Pop!_OS preserves the user's home directory.
