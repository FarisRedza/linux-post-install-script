# pop_os-post-install-script
Post install script for [Pop!_OS](https://pop.system76.com/)\
Works for both new installs and refresh installs from the built in recovery system in Pop!_OS

New install mode will install system level packages and configurations, as well as user level packages and configurations. Refresh install mode will only install system level packages and configurations, as the recovery system in Pop!_OS preserves the user's home directory. The script will reboot the computer and autostart itself when needed
